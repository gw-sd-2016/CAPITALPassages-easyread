                            Easy Read is a tool for instructors working with low literacy students who want the ability to simplify any text to the reading level of their students. <br>
                            It is a web application that allows the user to store, edit and view passages. The system has two types of users, instructors and students. <br>
                            Students view passages and answer questions on them. Instructors add passages and use the system to generate suggestions for simplifying the <br>
                            language to the target grade level. The system- generated suggestions can be taken or ignored and the passage can be saved again in <br>
                            modified form. Easy Read also provides options to tag passages by their category, source, or other identifiers to facilitate searching through a large number of stored passages. <br>
                            At its core, the system is based around dropping in text, giving its source and identifying information and letting the system identify problem areas. <br>
                            The passages are presented in searchable lists and the system keeps track of  answers on questions for each of those passages. Studentâ€™s answers are only viewable by themselves and 
                            their instructor and each instructor will have their own set of passages their students can access.

                        <strong>Bio:</strong>
                        Malcolm Goldiner is a Software Engineer from Brooklyn, New York. Malcolm has interned at MacHelpNYC and is primarily an iOS developer. <br>
                        Following graduation, Malcolm will be joining the LeagueApps team as a Full Stack Developer. LeagueApps is a leading SaaS platform for <br>
                        recreational sports teams and, as an avid Knicks fan, Malcolm is a perfect fit. Malcolm took on EasyRead because of its potential to be a <br>
                        meaningful project that has a positive effect on something besides his GPA. He hopes that EasyRead, at least in concept, will be part of a <br>
                        greater solution to the global illiteracy crisis.
