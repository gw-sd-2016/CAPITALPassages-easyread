                            Easy Read is a tool for instructors working with low literacy students who want the ability to simplify any text to the reading level of their students.  It is a web application that allows the user to store, edit and view passages. The system has two types of users, instructors and student.
                            Students view passages and answer questions on them. Instructors add passages and use the system to generate suggestions for simplifying the 
                            language to the target grade level. The system- generated suggestions can be taken or ignored and the passage can be saved again in 
                            modified form. Easy Read also provides options to tag passages by their category, source, or other identifiers to  
                            facilitate searching through a large number of stored passages. At its core, the system is based around dropping in text, giving its source and identifying information and letting the system identify problem areas. The passages are presented in searchable lists and the system keeps track 
                            of answers on questions for each of those passages. Studentâ€™s answers are only viewable by themselves and their instructor and each instructor
                             will have their own set of passages their students can access.

                            Malcolm Goldiner is a Software Engineer from Brooklyn, New York. Malcolm has interned at MacHelpNYC and is primarily an iOS developer.
                            Following graduation, Malcolm will be joining the LeagueApps team as a Full Stack Developer. LeagueApps is a leading SaaS platform for 
                            recreational sports teams and, as an avid Knicks fan, Malcolm is a perfect fit. Malcolm took on EasyRead because of its potential to be a 
                            meaningful project that has a positive effect on something besides his GPA. He hopes that EasyRead, at least in concept, will be part of a 
                            greater solution to the global illiteracy crisis.
